# The Team
This section includes a breif professional bio of each team member.

## Bryce Alexander
My name is Bryce Alexander, and I am a Senior Computer Science scholar at Florida A&M University. Originally from West Palm Beach, Florida, I discovered my passion for Web Development and UX/UI Design at an early age through coursework during my K-12 education. 
I have since honed my skills in these areas, focusing on creating user-centered and innovative solutions. On campus, I am actively engaged in organizations such as the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), Adobe, and BDPA, where I collaborate with peers to advance technological initiatives and personal development. 
Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring creative outlets such as photography and traveling, as well as spending time with family and friends. I also find inspiration in gaming, which fuels my interest in technology and interactive design. 
My creativity and problem-solving mindset are at the core of my approach to both academic and personal endeavors, driving me to deliver impactful and thoughtfully designed solutions. 

## Caleb Parker
My name is Caleb Parker, I am a native from Tallahassee, Florida, an active church member at Bethel Missionary Baptist Church, and a student at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University. 
My interests range from playing chess to endurance running, although I actively enjoy researching current events in my spare time. I am a dynamic individual that has had exposure to technical knowledge through my previous experiences in the world of Information 
Technology (IT) at an FSU IT camp in high school as well as various course loads at FAMU. Presently, I am a junior and my major is Computer Science. The purpose of my major is to gain the proper knowledge and fundamentals for a future path within a data science career, with the 
intent to earn a spot as a data analyst for my first entry level position. My interest in Information Technology and its applications in the real world have given me a greater understanding of how 
technology impacts the world on a day-to-day basis. I believe technology is not only the present but will change how we operate in the future. Personally, I am an inquisitive individual who 
is intrigued with solving problems that are centered around technology and also with other people. I also believe myself to be an ambivert. I can talk, but I don’t need to. I can work around 
various personality types and still gain effective outcomes, especially with tasks that I am experienced in. Furthermore, my skills that are unique to me, whilst simultaneously gained over 
time include: analytical skills, problem-solving skills, and communication skills. More specifically, I have had exposure to HTML, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Office, Web 
Design, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Outlook, academic writing and reading to name a few fundamental skills and tools I have used in the past. My technical skills include web 
development and its foundations and statistics and its foundations. My education prior to studying at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU) included a Florida-issued high-school diploma and IB Diploma from James S. Rickards High School, situated in 
Tallahassee, Florida. My recognitions for awards were claiming the Bright Futures Scholarship and being in the top 21% of my senior class among other recognitions. I aspire to gain more 
competencies in Microsoft Excel, Python, and SQL, C++, and database technology upon the time I graduate college and enter the career field of data analytics. With self-practice and internships, I will gain the experience and exposure to meet the demands of my field. 

## Jadon Ferrance
Jadon N. Ferrance is a Computer Science student at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU) with a strong focus on machine learning, data science, and ethical AI development. His technical expertise includes Python, C++, C#, and SQL, as well as advanced libraries such as SHAP, XGBoost, Scikit-learn, and Random Forest. 
Jadon has demonstrated his research and analytical skills through impactful projects, including Loan Prediction and Explainable AI, where he developed an interpretable machine learning model that achieved 89% accuracy while mitigating bias through SHAP analysis. His work on Bias in Arrest Rates for Marijuana Use leveraged exploratory data analysis and regression modeling to highlight systemic racial disparities in law enforcement data. Additionally, he has applied object-oriented programming principles to build scalable applications such as a Poker Simulation and a Shopping Cart System in C++. 
Beyond his technical projects, Jadon is passionate about mentorship and leadership. As a Fundamentals of Programming Tutor at FAMU, he has helped students strengthen their understanding of C++ programming, data structures, and algorithmic problem-solving, earning 90% positive feedback from students. He is an active member of the Google Developer Student Club, ACM (FAMU Chapter), and the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), where he continues to expand his professional network and technical knowledge. 
With a commitment to fair and interpretable AI, Jadon aims to pursue research opportunities that integrate ethical AI, predictive modeling, and data-driven decision-making. His long-term goal is to develop technology that is both high-performing and socially responsible, ensuring AI systems are transparent, fair, and beneficial to diverse communities. 

## Dwayne Williams
My name is Dwayne Williams, and I’m from Miami, Florida. I am a third-year Computer Science major here at Florida A&M University. I have always been fascinated by technology since a young age, always curious about how things work and how they can be improved. Over time, this interest led me to coding, where I developed a passion for problem-solving and creating new things. 
I have always been fascinated by coding and technology and how it shapes the world around us. I especially enjoy learning about game development, from programming mechanics to creating immersive experiences. Outside of academics, I like listening to all kinds of music and find it a great way to relax and stay motivated. 
I also enjoy both playing and watching football whenever I get the chance. I look forward to not only learning new skills but also using my knowledge to make an impact in the tech industry.
