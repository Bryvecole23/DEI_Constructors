# About the Project
For some years, DEI programs have been a lifeline for minority students in STEM, offering mentorship, career resources, and pathways into the tech industry. 
However, many of these programs are being dismantled or significantly reduced, leaving students—especially those at HBCUs like FAMU—without the same support systems that helped previous generations succeed. 
Without these resources, breaking into competitive fields like tech becomes even more challenging, making internships, professional development, and networking opportunities feel out of reach.
This project will be used to aid the structure of DEI programs. Specifically, to support minority students in STEM who are being underepresented due to changes in DEI structure. 
This project is to support backgrounds of people who need esential resources, advice and opportunities to help break into their field, irrespective of race. 
The focus is about opportunity for all those who are involved in places of fixed access and opportunity.


# Milestones
This section provides summaries of each milestone along with a link to a detailed document containing the corresponding artifacts

## Milestone 1
In this milestone, we formalized our project charter by developing the Project Charter and conducting a SWOT analysis. 
Additionally, we created a high-level budget and estimated the project timeline.

## Milestone 2
By developing our work breakdown structure (WBS), Gantt chart, use cases, API descriptions, research on other systems, and functional and non-functional needs, we continue our planning efforts and carry out our initial analyst activities at Milestone 2.
